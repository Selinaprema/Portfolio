# My Developer Portfolio 

## Project Description  
This project is a **developer portfolio website** that showcases my **skills, services, and projects** to potential clients. As a freelance web developer, I built this website to highlight my expertise in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  

## Portfolio Website Structure  
I structured my **index.html** file with the following sections:  

### ðŸ”¹ Menu  
- A **navigation bar** that allows visitors to easily explore different sections of my portfolio.  

### ðŸ”¹ About Me  
- A section introducing myself with my **name, profile image, and a short bio** explaining why clients should hire me.  

### ðŸ”¹ Services  
- A list of **services I provide**, such as Web Development, UI/UX Design, and SEO optimization.  

### ðŸ”¹ Testimonials  
- Two **testimonials** from happy (fictional) clients to add credibility.  

### ðŸ”¹ Portfolio  
- A section linking to **my JavaScript project (restaurant ordering system)** to showcase my skills.  
 I used **semantic HTML** elements (`<header>`, `<section>`, `<main>`, etc.) to ensure a well-structured and accessible webpage.
